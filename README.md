## Fresh Install Script

Version 0.1

A script to help me update, upgrade and install my most used software in a quick and clean manner for clean installs. This script reads the /etc/os-release for the PRETTY_NAME line so if that doesn't match the supported distros below then it won't work. Support for the following distros:
[] Fedora
[] Ubuntu
